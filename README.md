Code I've written while learning about SDL 2.

## Using My Code
The code is not licensed under any open source license. It used to be under the MIT license. However, since I am basing this code from Lazy Foo's SDL 2 tutorial and Lazy Foo recommended it, the code will only be copyrighted to me, but the code may still be viewed by anyone. If you would like to use any portion of the code, please contact me via [sfballais123@gmail.com](mailto:sfballais123@gmail.com) and let me know which portions will be used. Many portions are by Lazy Foo, which means you might have to ask permission from him, or have to consult his [FAQ](http://lazyfoo.net/faq.php). Some are either mine or my modification of Lazy Foo's code.

## Assets Used
The assets in this repository are a mix of assets created by me and third-party assets sourced from different websites. Please refer to the [Credits](#credits) to know more about where I obtained third-party assets.

The following assets are created by me and are licensed under [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). You may use the assets commercially, share, and produce derivative works upon them, as long as you give appropriate credits to me.

* All files under `data/key_presses`.
* `sample_texture.png` in `data/textures`.

## Notes

* I have skipped Lessons 19 and 20, both of which teach you about getting input from gamepads, due to lack of a working controller.

* I have skipped Lesson 37, which teaches you about using multiple displays, due to lack of a spare monitor. I could have used our TV, but using it for just one lesson would be a hassle for me.

## Credits
