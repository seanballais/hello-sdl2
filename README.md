# hello-sdl2
Code I've written while learning about SDL 2.

## Assets Used
The assets in this repository are a mix of assets created by me and third-party assets sourced from different websites. Please refer to the [Credits](#credits) to know more about where I obtained third-party assets.

The following assets are created by me and are licensed under [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). You may use the assets commercially, share, and produce derivative works upon them, as long as you give appropriate credits to me.

* All files under `data/key_presses`.
* `sample_texture.png` in `data/textures`.

## Notes

* I have skipped Lessons 19 and 20, both of which teach you about getting input from gamepads, due to lack of a working controller.
